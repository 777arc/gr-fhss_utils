## GNU Radio FHSS Utilities

This GNU Radio module contains tools for processing frequency hopping spread spectrum signals, as well as known and unknown bursty signals in general. Blocks derived from the gr-iridium project exist to detect narrowband bursts within wideband signals and downconvert and center them. Metadata is tracked through this process enabling reconstruction of where the bursts originated in time and frequency.
